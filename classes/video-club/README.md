# 🎬 Videoclub Project (Training Exercise)

This project simulates a small **Videoclub management system**, inspired by the tutorials from [desarrolloweb.com](https://desarrolloweb.com).  
It’s designed as a **learning exercise** to practice **incremental development**, **pair programming**, and **Git collaboration** using **PHP**.

---

## 🧠 Project Goal

The goal is to understand the basic workflow of a real development project:
- Setting up a PHP project and version control with Git.
- Using GitHub for collaboration.
- Practicing incremental feature development.
- Exploring teamwork dynamics through pair programming.

> ⚠️ Note: This project is purely educational.  
> Some implementation choices (like using `echo` inside classes or testing directly in the browser) are intentionally simplified for learning purposes and **should not** be used in real-world applications.

## 🧩 Project Structure
The project will gradually evolve, but its general idea includes:
- **Class definitions** for managing films, clients, and rentals.
- **Simple PHP scripts** to simulate videoclub operations.
- **Incremental commits** showing the development process step by step.
